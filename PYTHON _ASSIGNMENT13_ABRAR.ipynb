    "3. What modes do File objects for reader and writer objects need to be opened in?\n",
    "Ans: For csv.reader(iterable_file_object), the file objects needed to be opened in read mode mode='r' Whereas for csv.writer(iterable_file_object) the file objects needed to be opened in write mode mode='w'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What method takes a list argument and writes it to a CSV file?\n",
    "Ans: csv.writer class provides two methods for writing to CSV. They are writerow() and writerows(). writerow() method writes a single row at a time. Whereas writerows() method is used to write multiple rows at a time.\n",
